    <h2>Bootstrap Components Used In Project</h2>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <h3>Row and Columns</h3>
    <h3>Made user of Googles Iframes to display map Information</h3>
    <p>I made use of bootstraps row and columns feature. <br>
        I used them so that I would be easier to format my content throughout my 
        website</p>
    <br>
    <h2>NavBar </h2>
    <h3>ScrollSpy</h3>
    <p>I made use of BootStraps ScrollSpy so that navigating my website would be easy for the user </p>
    <h3>SideBar</h3>
    <p>I settled on using a sidebar instead of a typical horizontal navbar so that <br>
        The website would stand out to users and conent and navigation would feel more divided</p>
    <h3>Navbar</h3>
    <p>I still made use of Bootstraps standard navbar component so that my sidebar navigation would
        be more structed
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Home Screen</h2>
    <h3>Card & Card-img-top</h3>
    <p>I decided to use a card that would have an image set as the background so that users <br>
        Would find the home screen of the website visually interesting upon loading.
        This would mean they are more likely to want to stay.</p>
    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>I decided to use bootstrap buttons so that the buttons would pop and stand out to the user.</p>
    <h3>Toast and Progress</h3>
    <p>Upon clicking download i decided to add a little toast about the progress of the download <br>
        I decided to do this so that the user would have an indication from the website itself of what has happened <br>
        When they have clicked the download button</p>
    <h3>Modal</h3>
    <p>I used a modal on the contact me for the home screen even though I have a contact me section on the website. <br>
        This is because I wanted users to have quick access to contact me without it bringing them to the bottom of the website <br>
        and skipping the rest of the content</p>
    <h3>Text-Muted</h3>
    <p>I Used bootstaps text-muted class to de-emphasis some of the text on the home screen to let <br>
        Key info pop more</p>
    <h3>Icons</h3>
    <p>I made use of bootstrap icons for links to my social medias, I thought this was good <br>
        because instead of showing text I used the users familarity with these brands to get them to click the link</p>

    <br>

    <p>Accordions are a great way to hide Information from the user that they might not want to see. This also stops them feeling overloaded</p>
    <h3>List Groups</h3>
    <p>Using list groups helps make similar Information digestible</p>
